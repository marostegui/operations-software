compare-puppet-catalog is a small utility to assist in the migration of your
Puppet manifests from Puppet 2.7 to Puppet 3.0.

It has several levels of inceptions but should be easily runnable using the
provided Vagrant file.


== Preparing the environment ==

First of all, provision and start the vagrant box

    vagrant up

Fetch a tar archive of our production facts, i.e. on palladium:

    sudo tar cJf /tmp/puppet-facts.tar.xz /var/lib/puppet/yaml

and copy it to the base directory of compare-puppet-catalog on your
host.

Now, you should ssh into your vagrant box and become root

    vagrant ssh
    sudo -i
    export PATH="$PATH:/vagrant"
    # Set up your environment
    /vagrant/shell/helper install

This last command will take a while to execute. Now you can see the
help of the command 

    comparator -h

Comparator has three main working modes:

1) See the differences between catalogs compiled in puppet 2.7 and
puppet 3 on the production branch:

    comparator --numthreads 1 \
        --nodes amssq55.esams.wikimedia.org,fenari.wikimedia.org

if you omit --nodes, it will run on a predetermined set of nodes (see
below). If you have configured your vagrant box to have more than one
core, raise the --numthreads parameter to speed up catalog compilation.

2) See the effects of a Gerrit changeset on the puppet catalogs by
using the --change argument:

    comparator --numthreads 1 --change 130591 \
        --nodes amssq55.esams.wikimedia.org,fenari.wikimedia.org

3) Same as 1), but for a Gerrit changeset:

    comparator --numthreads 1 --change 130591 --transition\
        --nodes amssq55.esams.wikimedia.org,fenari.wikimedia.org

The run should produce, apart from some useless logs on stdout, a tree
of results, that you will be able to browse from your browser at one
of the following locations:

http://localhost:8080/html (case 1)

or

http://localhost:8080/change/<change_id>/html/ (case 2 or 3)

== Default node selection ==

By default, comparator selects the nodes to run onto intelligently: it
will inspect your site.pp (from the puppet tree to examine) and match
all the nodes you have facts for to it; then it will pick only one
(random) node matching any specific node definition. This way, we
should have 99% coverage with tests running on less than 15% of the hosts.
