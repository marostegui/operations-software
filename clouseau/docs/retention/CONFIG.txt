The data_auditor script requires the following config files:

config.yaml           -- general configuration settings
allhosts_ignored.yaml -- list of files/dirs/extentions
                         that will be ignored on all hosts
perhost_ignored.yaml  -- list of ignored dirs and files
                         per host (in addition to any rules
		         that might be stored in the sqlite db,
                         for which see below)

These should be in yaml format and stored in the config directory,
/srv/audits/retention/configs by default, on the salt master
and all minions.

In addition it maintains an sqlite db for storing the status rules
for files and directories for each host, by default located
in /etc/data_retention/dataretention_rules.sq3 on the salt
master.

Text files generated from the sq3 database are stored in
files named <fqdn>_store.conf for each host, on the salt master,
by default in the directory /etc/data_retention/data_retention.d
These files can be used to regenerate the sq3 database if
something should happen to it.

Yaml files also generated from the sq3 database are stored in
files named <fqdn>_store_good.conf for each host, on the salt master,
by default in the directory /srv/audits/retention/configs/fromstore
These files should be synced out to all salt minions every time
they are updated, which would be every time that the rules for
'good' files/dirs are changed on any host, via the interactive
mode to data_auditor or via the rulestore script.  If the
salt-cp feature of data_auditor is enabled, this will be
done automatically by the script via salt-cp; you should only
rely on this method if the size of the files is less than 100K.
However, the directory /srv/audits/retention/configs/fromstore
must already exist on the minions.
