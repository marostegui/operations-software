geturls is a script to call many URLs quickly and discard the results.  It is
useful when populating a read-through cache.  It has some performance
statistics, so can be used for basic load testing.

The one required argument to geturls is a text file containing a list of URLs,
one per line.  Each URL is called once, though the order may be slightly
shuffled due to the multithreaded nature.  (Restricting the number of threads
to 1 will ensure the URLs are called in order.)  Run 'geturls --help' for a
list of all options.
